## Introduction  
For the given Kaggle Dataset, I will perform prediction airline passenger satisfaction, statistical methods and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze a variety of factors, including flight time, seat comfort, in-flight service, on-time performance, and more. This analysis enables airlines to predict levels of passenger satisfaction and, in turn, improve their services based on the feedback and experience of their passengers. The selection of algorithms for this purpose is based on the highest accuracy of the results, typically derived from the Lazy Predict method, ensuring that the chosen model is well-suited to the task at hand..  

## Technical     
- Language : Python (filetype: **.ipynb**)  

## Content  
The main objective of predicting airline passenger satisfaction is to improve passenger experience, reduce customer churn, increase customer loyalty, and optimize customer service (CS) resources.
